## phylolm: R package for Phylogenetic Linear Regression on very large trees

The package provides functions for fitting phylogenetic linear models and phylogenetic generalized linear models. 
Computations use an algorithm that is linear in the number of tips in the tree. 
The package also provides functions for simulating continuous or binary traits along the tree.
When a new version is stable, it is pushed to CRAN, so the version available here is newer than that on CRAN.
